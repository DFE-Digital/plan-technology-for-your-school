# 0032 - Classes/Code Structure for DB Entities

* **Status**: proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we model our C# classes for reading/writing CMS models?

## Decision Drivers

- Development ease: how easy it is to develop and maintain the C# classes for the CMS and database.
- Speed/efficiency: how quickly and efficiently the database can be queried and updated.
- Best coding practices: following best practices for code maintainability and readability.
  
## Considered Options

### One class per content model

- We could simply amend our existing content models so that they are used for the CMS **and** for storing in the DB. 

#### Pros

- Much quicker to develop
  
#### Cons

- Worse coding practices: this approach violates the Single Responsibility Principle, as the same class is responsible for both the CMS and the database.
  - This can lead to code that is less maintainable, less extensible, and harder to understand.
  - Changes to the database schema can also have a ripple effect on the CMS (and vice versa).,

### Multiple classes for each content model

- For each content model:
  - One class for CMS 
  - One class for DB
  - As many view model classes as needed

#### Pros

- Best coding practice: this approach follows best practices for code maintainability and readability, as each class has a single responsibility.
- Easier to read: it would be easier to understand the code, as each class would have a clear purpose.
- Easier to understand: it would be easier to understand how the CMS and database interact with each other.
- More maintainable: this approach would be more maintainable in the long run, as changes to the database schema would not affect the CMS.

#### Cons

- Increased development time: creating multiple classes for each content model would require more development time.
- A lot more code changes: this approach would require more code changes, as there would be more classes involved.
- A lot of class mapping: this approach would require class mapping, which could be time-consuming.

## Decision Outcome

TBD
